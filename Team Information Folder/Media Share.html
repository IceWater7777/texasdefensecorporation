    <h2>
        We have created a Share for us to dump all of our pics and videos from the events we attend as well as any other Airsoft media (like pics of your gear, load-out,etc).<br><br><h2></h2>
<h4>In order for me to create and account for you I will need your email address. Please PM me with it so that I can get your account setup.
It's available to anyone who asks. So if you have taken pics or videos, I can create an account for you!
<br><br>There is no cost for this!</h4>
How to get the app...<br><br>
If you have an iPhone, get the app here:<br>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ds-file/id416751772
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ds-file/id416751772">Media Share Apple App</a>
<br><br>If you have an Android, get the app here:<br>
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.DSfile&hl=en_US&gl=US
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.DSfile&hl=en_US&gl=US">Media Share Android App</a>
<br><br>Enter Address:<br><br> kismeras.strangled.net:5001
<br><br>enter your username: I will provide this to you in a PM
<br><br>enter your password: I will provide this to you in a PM
<br><br>Enable: HTTPS
<br><br>You have the ability to change your password once you log in. I highly advise that you change your password!!!<br><br>
You can also access it from your computer using your web browser. Just go to this address...<br><br>
<a href="https://kismeras.strangled.net:5001/">PC Website</a><br><br>
Once you're logged in from the mobile app or your browser you should see a Folder called "TDC_Media". <br><br>There are folders within that folder that you can dump videos and pics in. <br><br>I will create folders for each event. <br><br>For example, you will see a folder for "878_Chris Kyle Foundation". <br><br>All of the videos and pics from that event should get dumped in there.<br><br>
If there is media that you want to dump, but no folder for it....create one. <br><br>For Example: Non event related pics and videos you want us to have can go in your own folder. <br><br>Just create a folder and name it the same as your account name (i.e.: I would create a folder named "papabear_Wasim")<br><br>Some of you have long call-signs so I'm going to shorten your account name for this Share.<br><br>
If you have any questions or need help, please message me or call me @ (813) 765-9743<br><br>
